we create a flight deal project to get the information from flight api about the cheapest flight of city name that i put it on google sheet and the information of cheapest flight was send by twilio
Use the Sheety API to GET all the data in that sheet google and print it out 
the sheet google was empty of iatacode of city name so we update the data of iataCode of all city 
by using amadeus api to get all information we need of flight like cost and date and the destination city and of course origin city 
so i put the origin iatacode city name of london that is LON to all aitacode on sheet google by using for loop 
then i get the cheapest flight and then send the cheapset flight sms message by using twilio 
note: iatacode is code of airport of city name 
best regards
